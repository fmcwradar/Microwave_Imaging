Here, I want to explain how to obtain the range FFT based on the measured IF signal.

The mixer on the transceiver PCB is the HMC8191 by Analog Devices, which is an I/Q mixer. The in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components are sampled with an oscilloscope. The start frequency of the ramp is 6 GHz and the stop frequency is 14 GHz. The ramp duration is set to 200 Âµs.
