In the journal paper, the algorithm for calculating the radar images is described in detail. Here, I would like to briefly demonstrate how important the correct modelling of the phase is. In the image below, the computed images of a two-target scenario are shown: on the left without correct phase modelling and on the right with it. It is evident that without correct phase modeling, the focusing does not work properly.
